As an Associate Professor in Behavioural Science at Durham University, my expertise is in social and organisational psychology with a focus on diversity and inclusion, organisational authenticity, team performance, leadership, and bias. I have extensive experience designing, implementing, and evaluating behavioural interventions using research-backed frameworks and techniques. I am also a Fellow of the Center for Evidence-Based Management.

I have been involved in research projects for the United Nations, NASA, and the US Navy Submarine School and have worked in a coaching / consultancy capacity with a number of Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies. I've also been invited to speak at various seminars, conferences, and panels across Europe and the United States.

My work with organisations is soundly based on the latest academic research and theory, but I strive to deliver it in an engaging, concise, and practical manner. I take an evidence-based approach to consultancy, drawing on my academic expertise to develop practical, cost-effective solutions.
